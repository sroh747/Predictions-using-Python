Here is my statement.
Is this really America? Terrible!
"The media and establishment want me out of the race so badly -  I WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE, WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN! #MAGA"
Certainly has been an interesting  hours!
"Debate polls look great - thank you!
#MAGA #AmericaFirst"
"WHAT THEY ARE SAYING ABOUT THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN’S ANTI-CATHOLIC BIGOTRY: 
 "
Thank you! #MAGA #AmericaFirst
"I will be in Cincinnati, Ohio tomorrow night at  join me! #OhioVotesEarly  
Tickets:  …"
Very little pick-up by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks. So dishonest! Rigged system!
Thank you Florida- a MOVEMENT that has never been seen before and will never be seen again. Lets get out &  on  #MAGA
"The very foul mouthed Sen. John McCain begged for my support during his  primary (I gave, he won), then dropped me over locker room remarks!"
Disloyal R's are far more difficult than Crooked Hillary. They come at you from all sides. They don’t know how to win - I will teach them!
With the exception of cheating Bernie out of the nom the Dems have always proven to be far more loyal to each other than the Republicans!
It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to.
"Our very weak and ineffective leader, Paul Ryan, had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty."
"Despite winning the second debate in a landslide (every poll), it is hard to do well when Paul Ryan and others give zero support!"
"Wow, @CNN got caught fixing their ""focus group"" in order to make Crooked Hillary look better. Really pathetic and totally dishonest!"
".@HillaryClinton is NOT above the law!
"
"My team of deplorables will be taking over my Twitter account for tonight's #debate
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain"
So many self-righteous hypocrites. Watch their poll numbers - and elections - go down!
"Wow, did you just hear Bill Clinton's statement on how bad ObamaCare is. Hillary not happy. As I have been saying, REPEAL AND REPLACE!"
I will be watching the great Governor @ and live tweeting the VP debate tonight starting at  est! Enjoy!
Just announced that Iraq (U.S.) is preparing for battle to reclaim Mosul. Why do they have to announce this? Makes mission much harder!
"Melania and I extend our warmest greetings to those observing Rosh Hashanah here in the United States, in Israel, and around the world."
Bernie should pull his endorsement of Crooked Hillary after she decieved him and then attacked him and his supporters.
" .@realDonaldTrump  There will be MASSIVE turnout for you,  Mr. Trump - These polls don't register the pulse of the PEOPLE!"
I have created tens of thousands of jobs and will bring back great American prosperity. Hillary has only created jobs at the FBI and DOJ!
I know our complex tax laws better than anyone who has ever run for president and am the only one who can fix them. #failing@nytimes
"Wow, just saw the really bad @CNN ratings. People don't want to watch bad product that only builds up Crooked Hillary."
The so-called Commission on Presidential Debates admitted to us that the DJT audio & sound level was very bad. So why didn't they fix it?
"Crooked H is nasty to Sanders supporters behind closed doors. Owned by Wall St and Politicians, HRC is not with you. …"
I believe in #AmericaFirst and that means FAMILY FIRST! My childcare plan reflects the needs of modern working-class families. #ImWithYou
"For those few people knocking me for tweeting at three o'clock in the morning, at least you know I will be there, awake, to answer the call!"
"Why isn't Hillary  points ahead? Maybe it's the email scandal, policies that spread ISIS, or calling millions of Americans deplorables!"
The people are really smart in cancelling subscriptions to the Dallas & Arizona papers & now USA Today will lose readers! The people get it!
"Remember, don't believe ""sources said"" by the VERY dishonest media. If they don't name the sources, the sources don't exist."
"Wow, Crooked Hillary was duped and used by my worst Miss U. Hillary floated her as an ""angel"" without checking her past, which is terrible!"
"Anytime you see a story about me or my campaign saying ""sources said,"" DO NOT believe it. There are no sources, they are just made up lies!"
"Wow, did you see how badly @CNN (Clinton News Network) is doing in the ratings. With people like @donlemon, who could expect any more?"
"While Hillary profits off the rigged system, I am fighting for you! Remember the simple phrase: #FollowTheMoney  …"
My condolences to those involved in today's horrible accident in NJ and my deepest gratitude to all of the amazing first responders.
"Every on-line poll, Time Magazine, Drudge etc., has me winning the debate. Thank you to Fox & Friends for so reporting!"
My supporters are the best!  million from hard-working people who KNOW what we can be again! Shatter the record: 
"Unbelievable evening in Melbourne, Florida w/  supporters- and an additional  who could not get in. Thank you! #TrumpTrain #MAGA"
Great afternoon in Little Havana with Hispanic community leaders. Thank you for your support! #ImWithYou
"In the last  hrs. we have raised over  from online donations and National Call Day, and we’re still going! Thank you America! #MAGA"
"Well, now they're saying that I not only won the NBC Presidential Forum, but last night the big debate. Nice!"
Thank you! #TrumpWon #MAGA …
Hillary's been failing for  years in not getting the job done - it will never change.
The  trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon - thank you!
I won every poll from last nights Presidential Debate - except for the little watched @CNN poll.
'How Trump won over a bar full of undecideds and Democrats' …
I really enjoyed the debate last night.Crooked Hillary says she is going to do so many things.Why hasn't she done them in her last  years?
"Thank you! Four new #DebateNight polls with the MOVEMENT winning. Together, we will MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN!

"Readout of my meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:
 …"
Looking forward to my meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu in Trump Tower at  A.M.
Bernie Sanders gave Hillary the Dem nomination when he gave up on the e-mails. That issue has only gotten bigger!
"Many on the team and staff of Bernie Sanders have been treated badly by the Hillary Clinton campaign - and they like Trump on trade, a lot!"
"If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him!"

"Hopefully the violence & unrest in Charlotte will come to an immediate end. To those injured, get well soon. We need unity & leadership."

"Thank you High Point, NC! I will fight for every neglected part of this nation & I will fight to bring us together as one American people!"
"Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary - see you at the debate!"
Do people notice Hillary is copying my airplane rallies - she puts the plane behind her like I have been doing from the beginning.
"Crooked Hillary has been fighting ISIS, or whatever she has been doing, for years. Now she has new ideas. It is time for change."
"Together, we will MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! #ImWithYou #AmericaFirst"
"Hillary Clinton's weakness while she was Secretary of State, has emboldened terrorists all over the world..cont:  "
Once again someone we were told is ok turns out to be a terrorist who wants to destroy our country & its people- how did he get thru system?
"Great job once again by law enforcement! We are proud of them and should embrace them - without them, we don't have a country!"
"Terrible attacks in NY, NJ and MN this weekend. Thinking of victims, their families and all Americans! We need to be strong!"
"Under the leadership of Obama & Clinton, Americans have experienced more attacks at home than victories abroad. Time to change the playbook!"
HAPPY BIRTHDAY - to the United States Air Force!!
"I would like to express my warmest regards, best wishes and condolences to all of the families and victims of the horrible bombing in NYC."
"My lawyers want to sue the failing @nytimes so badly for irresponsible intent. I said no (for now), but they are watching. Really disgusting"
"The failing @nytimes has gone nuts that Crooked Hillary is doing so badly. They are willing to say anything, has become a laughingstock rag!"
"Wacky @NYTimesDowd, who hardly knows me, makes up things that I never said for her boring interviews and column. A neurotic dope!"
".@CNN just doesn't get it, and that's why their ratings are so low - and getting worse. Boring anti-Trump panelists, mostly losers in life!"
I never met former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. He knows nothing about me. But look at the results under his guidance - a total disaster!
Crooked Hillary wants to take your  Amendment rights away. Will guns be taken from her heavily armed Secret Service detail? Maybe not!
My thoughts and prayers go out to the @PhillyPolice & @Penn police officers- in Philadelphia. …
"""Donald Trump’s birther event is the greatest trick he’s ever pulled"" "

Russia took Crimea during the so-called Obama years. Who wouldn't know this and why does Obama get a free pass?
Why isn't President Obama working instead of campaigning for Hillary Clinton?
"Just got back from Asheville,  North Carolina, where we had a massive rally. The spirit of the crowd was unbelievable. Thank you!  #MAGA"
Stopped by @TrumpDC to thank all of the tremendous men & women for their hard work!
"The seriously failing @nytimes, despite so much winning and poll numbers that will soon put me in first place, only writes dishonest hits!"
Hillary Clinton just had her  moment. What a terrible thing she said about so many great Americans!
"While Hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, I still respect them all!"
"Really sad that Republicans would allow themselves to be used in a Clinton ad. Lindsey Graham, Romney, Flake, Sass. SUPREME COURT, REMEMBER!"
"Wow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. I think it will cost her at the Polls!"

".@CNN is unwatchable. Their news on me is fiction. They
are a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the Clinton campaign."
The documentary of me that @CNN just aired is a total waste of time. I don't even know many of the people who spoke about me. A joke!
Final poll results from NBC on last nights Commander-in-Chief Forum. Thank you! #ImWithYou #MAGA
It wasn't Matt Lauer that hurt Hillary last night. It was her very dumb answer about emails & the veteran who said she should be in jail.
"More poll results from last nights Commander-in-Chief Forum. 
#AmericaFirst #TrumpTrain"
Hillary Clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past. She is totally confused. Unfit to serve as #POTUS.
Hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night. She's being decimated by the media!
"""A rough night for Hillary Clinton""  ABC News."
Thank you America - great #CommanderInChiefForum polls!

"Heading to Youngstown, Ohio now- some great polls. #AmericaFirst"
Can you believe that the Chinese would not give Obama the proper stairway to get off his plane - fight on tarmac! …
President Obama & Putin fail to reach deal on Syria - so what else is new? Obama is not a natural deal maker. Only makes bad deals!
"Lyin' Hillary Clinton told the FBI that she did not know the ""C"" markings on documents stood for CLASSIFIED. How can this be happening?"
"To the African-American community: The Democrats have failed you for fifty years, high crime, poor schools, no jobs. I will fix it, VOTE ""T"""
The polls are close so Crooked Hillary is getting out of bed and will campaign tomorrow.Why did she hammer  devices and acid-wash e-mails?
"Wow, the failing @nytimes has not reported properly on Crooked's FBI release. They are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source"
".@CNN is so disgusting in their bias, but they are having a hard time promoting Crooked Hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals."

Hillary Clinton is using race-baiting to try to get African-American voters- but they know she is all talk and NO ACTION!
Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself!
Just watched recap of #CrookedHillary's speech. Very short and lies. She is the only one fear-mongering!
"So many in the African-American community are doing so badly, poverty and crime way up, employment and jobs way down: I will fix it, promise"

Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!
"""Stay on message"" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets,  A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents!"
I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!
"It is not ""freedom of the press"" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!"
"I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!"
Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!
My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
"If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by "
"The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said"
The failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary!
We now have confirmation as to one reason Crooked H wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - PAY-FOR-PLAY. How can she run for Pres.
I am truly enjoying myself while running for president. The people of our country are amazing - great numbers on November 
The failing @nytimes has become a newspaper of fiction. Their stories about me always quote non-existent unnamed sources. Very dishonest!
"Thank you Erie, Pennsylvania! Together we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!"
ISIS gained tremendous strength during Hillary Clinton's term as Secretary of State. When will the dishonest media report the facts!
"I love watching these poor, pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out. They can't!"
A massive tax increase will be necessary to fund Crooked Hillary Clinton's agenda. What a terrible (and boring) rollout that was yesterday!
"Ratings challenged @CNN reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton) ""the founder"" of ISIS, & MVP. THEY DON'T GET SARCASM?"
"""@elsolarverde: THE CORRUPT MEDIA CREATS CONTROVERSY AGAINST @realDonaldTrump TO AVOID ISSUES ABOUT HillaryClinton "

Great job today by the NYPD in protecting the people and saving the climber.

"Thank you Wilmington, North Carolina!

"The media is going crazy. They totally distort so many things on purpose. Crimea, nuclear, ""the baby"" and so much more. Very dishonest!"
I see where Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake of Baltimore is pushing Crooked hard. Look at the job she has done in Baltimore. She is a joke!

"I am not just running against Crooked Hillary Clinton, I am running against the very dishonest and totally biased media - but I will win!"
"Heading to New Hampshire - will be talking about Hillary saying her brain SHORT CIRCUITED, and other things!"
"Anybody whose mind ""SHORT CIRCUITS"" is not fit to be our president! Look up the word ""BRAINWASHED."""
"Crooked Hillary said loudly, and for the world to see, that she ""SHORT CIRCUITED"" when answering a question on her e-mails. Very dangerous!"
Hillary Clinton is being badly criticized for her poor performance in answering questions. Let us all see what happens!

President Obama refuses to answer question about Iran terror funding.  I won't dodge questions as your President.  …
"Obama's disastrous judgment gave us ISIS, rise of Iran, and the worst economic numbers since the Great Depression!"
President Obama should ask the DNC about how they rigged the election against Bernie.
Happy  Birthday to the United States Coast Guard. Thank you @USCG! #CoastGuardDay

President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States!
The Washington Post calls out #CrookedHillary for what she REALLY is. A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR! Watch that nose grow!

Hillary Clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays & refuses to speak out against Radical Islam.

People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary....that's really saying something!
Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary?
When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary's pay-for-play at State Department?
CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton.
"This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!"

"I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!"
"Captain Khan, killed  years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our ""leaders"" to eradicate it!"

What Bernie Sanders really thinks of Crooked Hillary Clinton.
"Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary. She sold them out, V.P. pick!"
In Hillary Clinton's America - things get worse. 
"Crooked Hillary said that I ""couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign."" Really,I just beat  people and am beating her!"
Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me  times in her very long and very boring speech. Many of her statements were lies and fabrications!
"""@AnnCoulter: ""I believe in science"" Dem code for ""we're shutting down coal mines, steel plants and any other remaining manufacturing"""""
"Two policemen just shot in San Diego, one dead. It is only getting worse. People want LAW AND ORDER!"
"Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and ""forgot"" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream!"
No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.
"Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world."
"Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety."
Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!
Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
"Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a  increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country."
Median household income is down for the middle class since Obama took office. It will only go further down under Clinton.
"A vote for Clinton-Kaine is a vote for TPP, NAFTA, high taxes, radical regulation, and massive influx of refugees."

"If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's  illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI!"
Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic
"Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to ""carpet bomb"" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!"
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!
Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!
The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!
Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?
"I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!"
"No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!"
"You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is, and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. @megynkelly"
"For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia."
"In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy!"
Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.
The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!
"Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great"
"Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time."
"Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!"

"The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me"
Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on  Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing!
The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!
"If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild"
"Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!"
"There is no longer a Bernie Sanders ""political revolution."" He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!"
An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
"Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!"
"The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud!"
Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!
I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!
Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!
Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!
Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.
"Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED"
"Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!"

"To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests, we welcome you with open arms. People first."
Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton.
Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.
#CrookedHillary is not qualified! …
I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out!
"Bernie Sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry!"

"Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch, her time will come!"
"Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement."
"Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team ""were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information."" Not fit!"
Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!
"I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with ""murder."" Come November  she's out!"
Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win
FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem
"The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual, bad judgment."
Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!
Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?
"With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!"
"Crooked Hillary Clinton is ""guilty as hell"" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the  missing e-mails?"
"Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star, or plain star!"
Happy  of July!  #AmericaFirst  …
Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change!
"The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS.  dead in Baghdad, worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!"
I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!
"The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting ""go away, no pictures."""
"Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about ""grandkids"" and golf for  minutes in plane on tarmac?"
"""THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!"""
"On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!"
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged & corrupt!
Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.
"Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me.The good news-the people get it!"
"It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged!"
It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!

Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?
Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.
"As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!"
"The reason I put up approximately  million for my successful primary campaign is very simple, I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx.  million loan. I have totally terminated the loan!
The very dishonest @NBCNews refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my  million loan to my campaign. Done deal!
"One of the reasons Hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out America. 
 …"
"For reasons only they can explain, the @USChamber wants to continue our bad trade deals rather than renegotiating and making them better."
" @jakeda @realDonaldTrump As of April this year, Hillary had spent  on her campaign Mr.Trump  self funding"""
ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!
New Q poll out- we are going to win the whole deal- and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
Why would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters?
Iron Mike Tyson was not asked to speak at the Convention though I'm sure he would do a good job if he was. The media makes everything up!
We must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the United States.
"Yet another terrorist attack, this time in Turkey. Will
the world ever realize what is going on? So sad."
"Hillary Clinton’s Presidency would be catastrophic for
the future of our country. She is ill-fit with bad judgment."
"Benghazi is just another Hillary Clinton failure. It just
never seems to work the way it's supposed to with Clinton."

"The media is unrelenting. They will only go with and report a story in a negative light. I called Brexit (Hillary was wrong), watch November"
"Crooked Hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the U.S. Senate, goofy Elizabeth Warren, who lied on heritage."

"Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry. Shows me hitting shot, but I never did = lie! Was there to support son"
Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads. Disgraceful!
"Crooked Hillary Clinton, who called BREXIT  wrong (along with Obama), is now spending Wall Street money on an ad on my correct call."
"Just landed in New York - a one night stay in Scotland. Turnberry came out magnificently. My son, Eric, did a great job - under budget!"
Obama has blocked ICE officers and BP from doing their jobs. That ends when I am President!
I have never liked the media term 'mass deportation' -- but we must enforce the laws of the land!
We only want to admit those who love our people and support our values. #AmericaFirst
We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place.
"So funny, Crooked Hillary called BREXIT so incorrectly, and now she says that she is the one to deal with the U.K. All talk, no action!"
Thoughts and prayers are with everyone in West Virginia- dealing with the devastating floods. #ImWithYou
"Many people are equating BREXIT, and what is going on in Great Britain, with what is happening in the U.S. People want their country back!"
Crooked Hillary called it totally wrong on BREXIT - she went with Obama - and now she is saying we need her to lead. She would be a disaster
"America is proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder w/a free & ind UK. We stand together as friends, as allies, & as a people w/a shared history."
"Self-determination is the sacred right of all free people's, and the people of the UK have exercised that right for all the world to see."
"Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote. They took their country back, just like we will take America back. No games!"

Hillary says things can't change. I say they have to change. It's a choice between Americanism and her corrupt globalism. #Imwithyou
Crooked Hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief! She will be a disaster for jobs and the economy!
"Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State. She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! Corrupt, dangerous, dishonest."
"If you want to know about Hillary Clinton's honesty & judgment, ask the family of Ambassador Stevens."
Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays.
Hillary Clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe.
How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk?
"Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China  as
Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs."
"Hillary says this election is about judgment.  She's right.  Her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy."
I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton.
"Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament, according to new book, which is a mess!"

"I am watching @FoxNews and how fairly they are treating me and my words, and @CNN, and the total distortion of my words and what I am saying"
I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror. Hillary just broke-said she would now use!
What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough
 @realDonaldTrump Please make us safe. We cannot have Hillary as president. We will be in so much trouble.
"Reporting that Orlando killer shouted ""Allah hu Akbar!"" as he slaughtered clubgoers.  man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade."
Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace!
"Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!"
"Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims & their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough, smart & vigilant?"

"Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates, Lyin’ Ted Cruz. Honestly, I can’t blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion!"
"Lyin’ Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me, and lines from Michael Douglas— just another dishonest politician."

"Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November, paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices!"
"Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you, I will never forget!"
"Incompetent Hillary, despite the horrible attack in Brussels today, wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in.  No way!"

I will be making a big surprise announcement to the massive crowd assembled in Huntsville/Madison Alabama! Landing now! 
Little Marco Rubio is just another Washington D.C. politician that is all talk and no action. #RobotRubio
"Little Marco Rubio, the lightweight no show Senator from Florida is just another Washington politician."
As I stated at the press conference on Friday regarding David Duke- I disavow.
"Why would the people of Texas support Ted Cruz when he has accomplished absolutely nothing for them. He is another all talk, no action pol!"
"Little Marco Rubio, the lightweight no show Senator from Florida, is set to be the ""puppet"" of the special interest Koch brothers. WATCH!"
Making a big speech in Alabama today. So many people we had to move to a football stadium! Come and join us!
I am the only Republican who will get large numbers of Dems and Indies (crossover). I will also get states that no other Republican can get.

"Just watched lightweight Marco Rubio lying to a small crowd about my past record. He is not as smart as Cruz, and may be an even bigger liar"
"I started my business with very little and built it into a great company, with some of the best real estate assets in the World. Amazing!"
"I only wish my wonderful father, Fred, gave me  million to start my business like lightweight Rubio says. He didn't - total fabrication!"

They don't like Rubio in Florida- he left them high & dry. Doesn't even show up for votes!
"Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is, he is a choker, and once a choker, always a choker! Mr. Meltdown."
"Wow, every poll said I won the debate last night. Great honor!"
Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage. Not presidential material!
Lying Ted Cruz and lightweight choker  Marco Rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement. They failed!
Why would the people of Florida vote for Marco Rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their Senator and then quit!
"Have a good chance to win Texas on Tuesday. Cruz is a nasty guy, not one Senate endorsement and, despite talk, gets nothing done. Loser!"
"I will be making a speech at  in Fort Worth, Texas. Really big crowd expected. Will be talking about the debate last night-plus, plus!"

Signing a recent tax return- isn't this ridiculous?
"Just for your info, tax returns have  to do w/ someone’s net worth. I have already filed my financial statements w/ FEC. They are great!"
"Why doesn’t @MittRomney just endorse @marcorubio already.
Should have done it before NH or Nevada where he had a little sway. Too late

"I am growing the Republican Party tremendously - just look at the numbers, way up! Democrats numbers are significantly down from years past."
Ted Cruz lifts the Bible high into the air and then lies like a dog-over and over again! The Evangelicals in S.C. figured him out & said no!
Wow was Ted Cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication. He used him as a scape goat-fired like a dog! Ted panicked.

Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support!
Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact. Take ad down Ted. Biggest liar in politics!
"It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve, and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done."

Romney was the architect of ObamaCare. Bush’s Chief Justice legalized the monstrosity. Notice a trend?

Obama is a terrible negotiator. He bails out Chrysler and now Chrysler wants to send all Jeep manufacturing to China--and will!
Why is Obama’s auto bailout now creating jobs in China?  He is ruining American industry.

The polls & momentum  are trending towards @MittRomney. Don't let the hurricane change your thinking!
Maybe Obama should donate my  to the families of the  who have lost loved ones during the storm?
Scary.  Obama and the Democrat Senate have accrued over  worth of debt without passing a budget in the last  years.   more years?
Why does Obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? Hiding something?

These last  years have not had a single quarter over  GDP. Obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in American history.
The election is trending towards @MittRomney. Americans know we can't afford another  years of the Obama economic decline.

Many people walked out on Madonna's concert when she told them to vote for Obama. Years ago I walked out because the concert was terrible!
Obama lied  about Libya and the killings--emails are absolute. He must release his records on Wednesday and stop the lies.
"Dave Letterman @ said during my interview that Obama was ""probably"" born in the US--the word ""probably"" is a disaster for Obama."
I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my  offer to charity or to which charity the money will go.
"While @BetteMidler is an extremely unattractive woman, I refuse to say that because I always insist on being politically correct."
.@BetteMidler talks about my hair but I'm not allowed to talk about her ugly face or body --- so I won't. Is this a double standard?
I never liked @BetteMidler's persona or singing and haven't heard her name in years.
"Now grotesque @BetteMidler is into the Trump act --- trying to become
relevant again."
Many people are saying that my challenge to Obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers --- I agree.
"A lot changed when David Letterman said "" he was probably born in this country""--- the word probably is a total disaster for Obama."
Alert...The president knew that the ambassador was being attacked  in Benghazi. He did nothing...he is no leader.
"I put @DonnyDeutsch on Apprentice at his request, I did his failed cable show as a favor to him then he knocks me for my Obama announcement."
I want to end the day by saying there is no check I would rather write than that to a good charity designated by our President.
The TODAY Show should call me about who to put on the show— I know more about people who get ratings than anyone.
Watch Obama's favorability numbers drop even further if he doesn't accept my charitable offer. No one approves (cont)  
"If Obama doesn't accept my offer to be fully transparent, what will he say?"
"If my offer is refused, every undecided OH voter will be fully aware that Obama denied  to charity all because he is hiding something!"
Barack Obama has everything to gain. Why would anyone ever deny  to charity?
Sarah Jessica Parker voted “unsexiest woman alive” – I agree. She said “it’s beneath me to comment on the...  
I have decided to add a caveat to my offer. Obama can't decide to send my  to Rev. Wright if he releases his records.
My fellow Tea Party friends in Ohio--make sure you take advantage of early voting so you can GOTV election day. Know you can! Must win Ohio.
Pretty audacious for Obama to call @MittRomney a BSer when he has lied about so much we don't have room to write.
"By the way, where is @Oprah? Good question.  years ago she strongly supported Obama--now she is silent. Anyway, who cares, I adore Oprah."

Obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester. The Middle East is a mess. Yet Colin Powell still endorses him. Wonder why?

The election is still close but trending toward @MittRomney. He leads all national polls and Obama's likeability is imploding. VOTE!

Watch me explain on the @ how my charitable offer to Obama changes the election and is about transparency  
I knew last year that @TIME Magazine lost all credibility when they didn't include me in their Top 
The Letterman show really turned things around- people finally understand my  million dollar offer to charity....  
"Based on the ovation last night from the Letterman @ audience, I believe it will be hard for Obama to throw  down the drain...."
Another great charity that the  could go to just a recommendation to the Pres. - the Wounded Warriors represented so well by @TraceAdkins
Lots of response that Obama should give the  to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in Benghazi.
"""The dealmaker is cunning, secretive, focused and never settles for less than he wants."" --The America We Deserve"
It is really a shame that Barack Obama may stop  from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent.
Doing David Letterman @ tonight at   nite of Sweeps.Going into the lion's den but I've been there many times before. Enjoy
Six days and counting until my offer to Barack Obama expires...
"For someone who demanded  years of Mitt's tax returns, you would think my offer to donate  to charity for his records is an easy go."
"Yesterday Barack Obama said he wants ""wind turbines manufactured here in China""   I don't think this was a gaffe."
China is primed to continue to rob us and steal our jobs through their exports    We need @MittRomney to rein them in.
I hope Derek Jeter’s recovery is going well.  He is a very special player and a great guy.  New York loves him. @yankees
"""Trump Offers To Donate  Million To Charity If Obama Releases College Transcripts""   via @rcpvideo"
What will be the response on Wednesday? If Obama doesn't take the  million dollars for charity.
I am offering the chance for Barack Obama to redistribute  to any charity of his choice.  Everyone wins.  Take the deal.
"Just stated by a total pro: ""You are the only one who has the guts to say what we are all thinking."""
Glad to hear North Carolina is solid for @MittRomney.  It started trending for Mitt solidly after my speech at the @NCGOP convention.
"In light the Benghazi emails released last night, it is apparent that Obama has no problem lying to the American public..."
"... By releasing his records, he can come clean with the American people and have  million go to a charity."
Obama has no problem leaking national security secrets.  Why can't he release his records?  Especially when  is going to charity.
I am happy to donate  million to a charity Barack Obama chooses.  All I am asking is that he is transparent with the American people
RT @APCampaign:Trump to Obama:  million donation to charity if you release passport and college records   
Glad to hear @seanhannity supports my offer to Obama.  As Sean says “it is an easy  million to charity.  What does Obama have to lose?”
My offer to Obama is about transparency. In  American people were sold on hope and change. This our last chance to get the full record.
RT @ReutersPolitics: Trump to give  million to charity if Obama releases records 
The response has been fantastic--- actually overwhelming! Thank you!
"As stated, here is the press release.  "
"You have all been waiting-- the response has been amazing! Watch my announcement now, press release to follow at  "
All predictions re: my  o'clock release are totally incorrect.  Stay tuned!
Story will be released today at  noon EST on Twitter and Facebook.

If you like having the world collapse and being told America is leading from behind--vote Obama.
"Everyone is asking me to speak more on Robert & Kristen.I don't have time except to say ""Robert, drop her, she cheated on you & will again!"""
"Last night was the first time Obama said ""we"" instead of ""I"" in respect to Bin Laden's killing."
Barack Obama said absolutely not  times before he agreed to go after Bin Laden--- now he wants all of the credit!
My announcement is tomorrow!
Tomorrow I will be tweeting on only one subject!
China will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own!
"Mitt Romney must start congratulating the Navy Seals and military on Bin Laden’s killing, not the President."
.@MittRomney should have been more aggressive last night. Yet some polls have him winning the debate.
"The military and Navy Seals should be given more credit for Bin Laden's death, not Obama, who works hard to take (cont)  "
"When the military informed Obama that they had Bin Laden, is there anyone with a brain that would not have said ""Ok, go get him""?"

 of the Chinese say they are better off than they were  years ago    At least someone has done well under Obama.
The debate was pretty even but I thought Mitt should have been much more aggressive on Obama's failed foreign policy-- and I mean much more.
Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden. #debate
".@MittRomney looks much calmer, and Obama should stop nodding his head backwards and forward."
Bob Schieffer will do a great job tonight. Always treated me fairly.
"Well this is it, the final debate- let's see how it goes. I'll be tweeting live."
Why don't we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden? They don't seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit. All he did is say O.K.
I look forward to @MittRomney hitting Obama hard tonight for lying about Benghazi. CIA told Obama it was a terrorist attack after  hrs.
Everybody is asking about my announcement this Wednesday concerning Barack Obama---just wait and see!
"Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart. In a couple of years, he will thank me. Be smart, Robert."
"Obama is an easy target on foreign policy.@MittRomney has many openings to attack, especially when Obama starts bragging about Bin Laden."
"""This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility."" Obama to @MedvedevRussiaE discussing our nuclear arsenal."
Obama planted that @nytimes story on Iran so it will be discussed in tonight's debate. He wants Libya and China off the table.
The brass in #TRUMP Tower's atrium is polished twice a month like clockwork. I keep the atrium impeccable. Key to its success!
...now @AlexSalmond doesn't like me--who cares!
".@Toure I felt very sorry for you during your meltdown on @PiersMorgan. He drove you insane but, of course, Piers is a lot smarter than you"
My son Don and his wife Vanessa just had a beautiful baby boy named Spencer Frederick --very thrilling.
Don't let Obama play the Iran card in order to start a war in order to get elected--be careful Republicans!
".@Toure, when you are fired from MSNBC for your bad ratings and racist coverage, stop by and say hello."
Autism rates through the roof--why doesn't the Obama administration do something about doctor-inflicted autism. We lose nothing to try.
We should march on Washington re:autism--with leadership & common sense the numbers would drop precipitously!
"Lots of autism and vaccine response. Stop these massive doses immediately. Go back to single, spread out shots! What do we have to lose."
"Via @politico: ""Donald Trump claims Barack Obama bombshell"" "
Stay tuned for my big Obama announcement--- probably on Wednesday. 
People are going crazy with my comments on Diet Coke (soda). Let's face it--this stuff just doesn't work. It makes you hungry.
"The anti-wind turbine movement in Scotland against @AlexSalmond is amazing--keep going Scots, save your country!"
Obama should stop talking about wind turbines--they are a disaster for a country or community & are very expensive & unreliable.
I will be live tweeting during the debate tonight.
Gas prices are at crazy levels--fire Obama!
"""They succeed, because they think they can."" -- Virgil"
The biggest problem with A-Rod is he is bad for the chemistry of the Yankees--- he must go.
Fort Hood shooting should be declared a terror attack. Respect the wounded and dead.
Good luck to Derek on his operation. I know it will be a success--- he is a great champion.
Derek Jeter broke ankle one day after he sold his apartment in Trump World Tower.
.@MittRomney's @RNC convention came in over  under budget.  Barack’s @DNC convention is over  in debt.  What a surprise!
"No surprise, welfare spending is up over  under Obama.    He is the food stamp & welfare ""king"""
".@VanityFair's terrible piece on Mitt's faith is a new low, even for them."
"Rev. @BillyGraham is a great man and so is his son, Franklin Graham."
Both Barack and @MittRomney were excellent at the Al Smith dinner last night!
A lot of the @Yankees should be ashamed of their play in the post season. They are lucky they don't have to deal with George Steinbrenner.
I hope @boyscouts of America handle their problems a lot better than the board at Penn State did. You can't do any worse!
Newly released NH poll has @MittRomney with a  point lead. Mitt will pull away next week.
"Obama has called Libya attack ""a bump in the road"" and ""not optimal."" Just come clean already--tell Americans the truth!"
Maybe Derek Jeter should ask A-Rod about renting his apartment next year. Very soon A-Rod won't need a place in NYC.
Yes--I will be live tweeting during the final debate this coming Monday.
My interview with @IngrahamAngle discussing the real unemployment number and how the  number is a fraud 
.@katyperry is no bargain but I don't like John Mayer--he dates and tells--be careful Katy (just watch!).

Why would Ohio listen to Bruce Springsteen reading his lines? Be careful or I will go to Ohio and @MittRomney will win it!

I'll be making a major announcement on President Obama next week--stay tuned!

My Trump Home Mattress Collection by Serta is setting records--they are really phenomenal. You can order them at  
The last time I visited China I couldn't believe all the construction. You can go up with a project in a week--no red tape.
It's Thursday. How much money did Barack Obama waste today on crony green energy projects?
"Clinton commented in Ohio today that @MittRomney is right, the economy has not been fixed under Obama.I always said Bill was an honest man."
"When Strasburg leaves @Nationals for another team for more money, will Washington still like the decision to shut him down for his good?"
Bad sign for Obama's campaign now publicly admitting they are focused on  states. Their internals must be horrendous.
"Now there is talk of A-Rod being shipped to @Marlins. If A-Rod is not a @yankee next year, the fans will be happy."
Robert I'm getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump Kristen- but I'm right. If you saw the Miss Universe girls you would reconsider.

Obama's spending and borrowing is burying America and destroying our children's future. Does he even care?
"Great--now Supreme Court Justices are talking about a constitutional right to a cell phone   Obama, just stop already."
Mitt's proposed tax cuts for the middle class will spur record economic growth.
"Under his administration, oil and gas production on public land is down over     Obama did not tell truth last night."
If Obama goes after Mitt's private sector experience in the next debate then Mitt should ask for Obama's college records--all of them.
What is never said is that people take a big risk with their money and can lose it all. We should be given credit for taking this risk.
Can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been for the country if the candidates actually did get into a fist fight?
Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart. She cheated on him like a dog & will do it again--just watch. He can do much better!
Michael Vick of the Philadelphia @eagles is a great athlete but not a great quarterback.
Initial reports say  debate viewership dropped. See what happens when I am not mentioned.
Just read about my friend @HulkHogan--he was set up--too bad he has to use the court system instead of his muscles.
Last Saturday A-Rod was  and left  stranded. But he was still hitting on girls from the dugout    He is very selfish!
CC is a great pitcher and can handle pressure--@Yankees will win tonight. So far my predictions have all been correct.
"Obama talks about what he is going to do--why the hell didn't he just do it, especially in the first  years when he had all votes necessary"
"Remember, new ""environment friendly""  lightbulbs can cause cancer. Be careful-- the idiots who came up with this stuff don't care."
My twitter has become so powerful that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth.
Polls are starting to look really bad for Obama. Looks like he'll have to start a war or major conflict to win. Don't put it past him!
Do you believe Barack Hussein Obama (aka Barry Soetoro) looked like a president last night? I don't!
"Obama has zero credibility on oil and coal. If we do not win energy as a country, we just do not win, period!"
"Remember, I said Derek don't sell your Trump World Tower apartment...its been lucky for you. The day after he sold it, he broke his foot."
"At the debate, the President kept talking of what he is going to do. I kept saying, why didn't he do it?  He lost me a long time ago."
Debate showed--- these guys really hate each other. At one point it looked like they would come to blows. 
"Obama better than last time, but again, @MittRomney wins. Good night. #debate"
"You talk tough, Mr. President, but have done nothing about China killing our jobs and economy."
Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama. No wonder nothing gets done.
.@MittRomney much better on Libya and Middle East problems. Obama has no answer.
Obama keeps namedropping Bill Clinton-- he is no Bill Clinton.
"Obama weak on immigration. All words, no action. He's been Prez  years."
Obama is looking rhetorical and weak. @MittRomney is looking strong and sharp.
"Obama just said @MittRomney was ""a very successful investor""--- big mistake for Obama to admit- he has less and less credibility."
Obama keeps saying that he will do something--- but why hasn't he done it? It's all talk.
.@MittRomney looks much stronger and much more Presidential!
Then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices?
Good response on jobs by @MittRomney.
Why has Obama let China and others take our jobs?
Why hasn't Obama created jobs?
"Getting ready to watch the debate--- as they say ""let's get ready to rumble""!"
We should be able to negotiate a deal with Iran because they know we could blow them away to the Stone Age.They just don't believe we would.
"For political purposes only, Obama is planning to hit Libya for the Benghazi embassy attack right before the election?"
Get ready for tonight!
.@MittRomney--if Obama gets wise tonight just ask for his college records & transcripts--he will quiet down quickly.
Good luck @MittRomney tonight--have no doubt you will be great.
Congratulations to @JamesOKeefeIII on exposing more Democrat voter fraud.  @DNC was caught red handed telling people to vote twice.
I bet the terrorists in Libya used weapons we supplied them during their so called 'revolution' to attack our embassy in Benghazi.
"Between Libya, the national security leaks and Fast & Furious, Obama has had more national security scandals than any other President."
"Because Obama was so pathetic in the first debate, tonight's audience will be humongous--people want to see if he is for real."
"The Coca Cola company is not happy with me--that's okay, I'll still keep drinking that garbage."
Obama just had another trillion dollar budget deficit for the fourth year in a row. At least he is consistent.
I turned down going to the debate tonight so that I could do live tweets to my many followers.
I have no doubt that Mitt will do really well tonight. We'll all be watching @MittRomney.

Obama is planning on attacking Romney on Bain in tomorrow's debate    Mitt should bring up college applications & records
Once again Obama fails to classify China as a currency manipulator. He just helped China steal even more jobs and money from us.
A-Rod should donate his contract to charity. He doesn't make the @yankees any money and he doesn't perform. He is a  rip off.
Looking forward to speaking at tonight's gala for @MittRomney supporters at the Intrepid. Mitt's doing well.
Barack Obama is not who you think he is. Most overrated politician in US history.
Isn't it time that Obama release his college records and applications? Boy would that create a mess! He is not who you think.
"Lots of response to my comment on Diet Coke- let's face it, it doesn't work- just makes you hungry."
A-Rod was a great player when he lived at Trump Park Avenue--- even though he was on the juice!
Derek Jeter had a great career until  days ago when he sold his apartment at Trump World Tower- I told him not to sell- karma?
I love @LibertyUniversity--such great people!
A-Rod is just not making it. We want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great.
Obama will be trying very hard at next debate- he doesn't want to lose the Boeing.
Who says Obama will do better in the next debate- has he gotten smarter in  weeks!

I have never seen a thin person drinking  Diet Coke.
"No, I wasn't at the @Yankees game yesterday- can't go today either. When I go, they win."
A bad thing finally happened to Derek Jeter--- he is a great champion.
Everyone's wondering what's wrong with A-Rod. Not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore-- the real reason. 
They found Jessica in Colorado--- body was mutilated--- death to the pervert killer.
I'll bet Obama goes down just like Washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win.

ObamaCare is a complete disaster. Many of my friends have to scale down their businesses because they can't afford it. Terrible.
Pretty even debate- no knockouts. However Ryan's closing statement somewhat stronger. What do you think? #VPDebate
Biden's statements on Medicare are very effective. Ryan must now come back and combat. #VPDebate
Excellent story on @MittRomney- very good moment for Ryan. #VPDebate
Biden's sarcastic smiling may or may not be effective depending on who is watching. #VPDebate
Hard for Biden to justify Libya mess but doing best he can. #VPDebate
Both candidates are looking sharp- now it's up to the mouth and the mind. #VPDebate
Get ready- this should be informative and fun! #VPDebate
Looking forward to the debate tonight and will be tweeting live with very honest assessment.
Why does Barack Obama's ring have an arabic inscription?   Who is this guy?

The public is about to learn a lot more information on Barack Obama and his true background in the coming weeks…
Now that Obama’s poll numbers are in tailspin – watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran.  He is desperate.

.@BetteMidler talks about my hair but I'm not allowed to talk about her ugly face or body --- so I won't. Is this a double standard?
I never liked @BetteMidler's persona or singing and haven't heard her name in years.
"Now grotesque @BetteMidler is into the Trump act --- trying to become
relevant again."
Many people are saying that my challenge to Obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers --- I agree.
"A lot changed when David Letterman said "" he was probably born in this country""--- the word probably is a total disaster for Obama."
Alert...The president knew that the ambassador was being attacked  in Benghazi. He did nothing...he is no leader.
"I put @DonnyDeutsch on Apprentice at his request, I did his failed cable show as a favor to him then he knocks me for my Obama announcement."
I want to end the day by saying there is no check I would rather write than that to a good charity designated by our President.
The TODAY Show should call me about who to put on the show— I know more about people who get ratings than anyone.
Watch Obama's favorability numbers drop even further if he doesn't accept my charitable offer. No one approves (cont)  
"If Obama doesn't accept my offer to be fully transparent, what will he say?"
"If my offer is refused, every undecided OH voter will be fully aware that Obama denied  to charity all because he is hiding something!"
Barack Obama has everything to gain. Why would anyone ever deny  to charity?
Sarah Jessica Parker voted “unsexiest woman alive” – I agree. She said “it’s beneath me to comment on the...  
I have decided to add a caveat to my offer. Obama can't decide to send my  to Rev. Wright if he releases his records.
My fellow Tea Party friends in Ohio--make sure you take advantage of early voting so you can GOTV election day. Know you can! Must win Ohio.
Pretty audacious for Obama to call @MittRomney a BSer when he has lied about so much we don't have room to write.
"By the way, where is @Oprah? Good question.  years ago she strongly supported Obama--now she is silent. Anyway, who cares, I adore Oprah."

Six days and counting until my offer to Barack Obama expires...
"For someone who demanded  years of Mitt's tax returns, you would think my offer to donate  to charity for his records is an easy go."
"Yesterday Barack Obama said he wants ""wind turbines manufactured here in China""   I don't think this was a gaffe."
China is primed to continue to rob us and steal our jobs through their exports    We need @MittRomney to rein them in.

"Just stated by a total pro: ""You are the only one who has the guts to say what we are all thinking."""

"In light the Benghazi emails released last night, it is apparent that Obama has no problem lying to the American public..."
"... By releasing his records, he can come clean with the American people and have  million go to a charity."
Obama has no problem leaking national security secrets.  Why can't he release his records?  Especially when  is going to charity.
I am happy to donate  million to a charity Barack Obama chooses.  All I am asking is that he is transparent with the American people
RT @APCampaign:Trump to Obama:  million donation to charity if you release passport and college records   
Glad to hear @seanhannity supports my offer to Obama.  As Sean says “it is an easy  million to charity.  What does Obama have to lose?”
My offer to Obama is about transparency. In  American people were sold on hope and change. This our last chance to get the full record.

Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden. #debate

Bob Schieffer will do a great job tonight. Always treated me fairly.
"Well this is it, the final debate- let's see how it goes. I'll be tweeting live."
Why don't we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden? They don't seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit. All he did is say O.K.
I look forward to @MittRomney hitting Obama hard tonight for lying about Benghazi. CIA told Obama it was a terrorist attack after  hrs.

Stay tuned for my big Obama announcement--- probably on Wednesday. 
People are going crazy with my comments on Diet Coke (soda). Let's face it--this stuff just doesn't work. It makes you hungry.
"The anti-wind turbine movement in Scotland against @AlexSalmond is amazing--keep going Scots, save your country!"
Obama should stop talking about wind turbines--they are a disaster for a country or community & are very expensive & unreliable.
I will be live tweeting during the debate tonight.

Newly released NH poll has @MittRomney with a  point lead. Mitt will pull away next week.

It's Thursday. How much money did Barack Obama waste today on crony green energy projects?
"Clinton commented in Ohio today that @MittRomney is right, the economy has not been fixed under Obama.I always said Bill was an honest man."
"When Strasburg leaves @Nationals for another team for more money, will Washington still like the decision to shut him down for his good?"
Bad sign for Obama's campaign now publicly admitting they are focused on  states. Their internals must be horrendous.
"Now there is talk of A-Rod being shipped to @Marlins. If A-Rod is not a @yankee next year, the fans will be happy."
Robert I'm getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump Kristen- but I'm right. If you saw the Miss Universe girls you would reconsider.

Mitt's proposed tax cuts for the middle class will spur record economic growth.
"Under his administration, oil and gas production on public land is down over     Obama did not tell truth last night."
If Obama goes after Mitt's private sector experience in the next debate then Mitt should ask for Obama's college records--all of them.
What is never said is that people take a big risk with their money and can lose it all. We should be given credit for taking this risk.
Can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been for the country if the candidates actually did get into a fist fight?
Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart. She cheated on him like a dog & will do it again--just watch. He can do much better!

"At the debate, the President kept talking of what he is going to do. I kept saying, why didn't he do it?  He lost me a long time ago."
Debate showed--- these guys really hate each other. At one point it looked like they would come to blows. 
"Obama better than last time, but again, @MittRomney wins. Good night. #debate"
"You talk tough, Mr. President, but have done nothing about China killing our jobs and economy."
Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama. No wonder nothing gets done.
.@MittRomney much better on Libya and Middle East problems. Obama has no answer.
Obama keeps namedropping Bill Clinton-- he is no Bill Clinton.
"Obama weak on immigration. All words, no action. He's been Prez  years."
Obama is looking rhetorical and weak. @MittRomney is looking strong and sharp.
"Obama just said @MittRomney was ""a very successful investor""--- big mistake for Obama to admit- he has less and less credibility."
Obama keeps saying that he will do something--- but why hasn't he done it? It's all talk.

Good luck @MittRomney tonight--have no doubt you will be great.
Congratulations to @JamesOKeefeIII on exposing more Democrat voter fraud.  @DNC was caught red handed telling people to vote twice.
I bet the terrorists in Libya used weapons we supplied them during their so called 'revolution' to attack our embassy in Benghazi.
"Between Libya, the national security leaks and Fast & Furious, Obama has had more national security scandals than any other President."
"Because Obama was so pathetic in the first debate, tonight's audience will be humongous--people want to see if he is for real."
"The Coca Cola company is not happy with me--that's okay, I'll still keep drinking that garbage."

Obama is planning on attacking Romney on Bain in tomorrow's debate    Mitt should bring up college applications & records
Once again Obama fails to classify China as a currency manipulator. He just helped China steal even more jobs and money from us.
A-Rod should donate his contract to charity. He doesn't make the @yankees any money and he doesn't perform. He is a  rip off.
Looking forward to speaking at tonight's gala for @MittRomney supporters at the Intrepid. Mitt's doing well.
Barack Obama is not who you think he is. Most overrated politician in US history.
Isn't it time that Obama release his college records and applications? Boy would that create a mess! He is not who you think.
"Lots of response to my comment on Diet Coke- let's face it, it doesn't work- just makes you hungry."
A-Rod was a great player when he lived at Trump Park Avenue--- even though he was on the juice!
Derek Jeter had a great career until  days ago when he sold his apartment at Trump World Tower- I told him not to sell- karma?
I love @LibertyUniversity--such great people!
A-Rod is just not making it. We want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great.
Obama will be trying very hard at next debate- he doesn't want to lose the Boeing.
Who says Obama will do better in the next debate- has he gotten smarter in  weeks!
.@MittRomney's poll numbers are looking really good. One more great debate performance and it will be a total knockout. 
I have never seen a thin person drinking  Diet Coke.
"No, I wasn't at the @Yankees game yesterday- can't go today either. When I go, they win."
A bad thing finally happened to Derek Jeter--- he is a great champion.
Everyone's wondering what's wrong with A-Rod. Not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore-- the real reason. 
They found Jessica in Colorado--- body was mutilated--- death to the pervert killer.
I'll bet Obama goes down just like Washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win.

"""There are many ways of going forward, but only one way of standing still."" -- Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt"
ObamaCare is a complete disaster. Many of my friends have to scale down their businesses because they can't afford it. Terrible.
Pretty even debate- no knockouts. However Ryan's closing statement somewhat stronger. What do you think? #VPDebate
Biden's statements on Medicare are very effective. Ryan must now come back and combat. #VPDebate
Excellent story on @MittRomney- very good moment for Ryan. #VPDebate
Biden's sarcastic smiling may or may not be effective depending on who is watching. #VPDebate
Hard for Biden to justify Libya mess but doing best he can. #VPDebate
Both candidates are looking sharp- now it's up to the mouth and the mind. #VPDebate
Get ready- this should be informative and fun! #VPDebate
Looking forward to the debate tonight and will be tweeting live with very honest assessment.

.@DavidLetterman @ fully apologized last night for calling me a racist. Thank you David--we are again friends.
The public is about to learn a lot more information on Barack Obama and his true background in the coming weeks…
Now that Obama’s poll numbers are in tailspin – watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran.  He is desperate.

"We've made a lot of progress, but there's still more work to do."
"Six years later, and Republican leaders still have no credible #Obamacare alternative."
Judge Garland is a well qualified nominee. Senate leaders' refusal to even give him a hearing is unacceptable.
